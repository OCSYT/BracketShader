## FAQ

#### Examples?

Open the folder BracketShader/Examples and open Example Scene.unity

#### Why is my toon shader black?

If there are no dynamic lights in the scene, 
the avatar will appear as black while using the toon shader, 
please set brightness to "1" and set a fake shading texture.
An example of this is the AVATAREXAMPLE 
material found in the BracketShader folder.

#### Why does my material look weird?
Make sure  you have a texture set for every 
texture slot, if you dont want to use a texture 
please set the "black", "white" or "normal"
 textures in the slot found in
 BracketShader/Textures/Essential
